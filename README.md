Info
----

This repository is a testing repository for the implementation of an open-source version of PC-SAFT in C++

Currently, it just calculates the compressibility factor Z as a function of density and T, and all constants are hard-coded.  For now it is only a proof-of-principle.

Eventually, the goal is to integrate it back into CoolProp in some fashion.
