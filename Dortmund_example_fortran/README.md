**************************
Debuggable FORTRAN example
**************************

The files in this folder are derived from the FORTRAN example code posted at https://www.th.bci.tu-dortmund.de/en/research/pc-saft/download

The code in this folder can be dumped into an Eclipse project on linux and compiled and debugged in order to see what the variables should be.

The original FORTRAN code itself is not well documented (units, anyone?) so you need to have a copy of Gross&Sadowski next to you when you read the TEST() function code
